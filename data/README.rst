☤ About data directory
------------

This directory is used to store open source data. Because data collected by Beacon is mass and we had to put it here, we plan to open source data gradually.

Data categories are:

- ES_COMP
    (Data collected by Beacon from compute nodes node by node)
- ES_FWD1
    (Data collected by Beacon from default forwarding nodes)
- ES_FWD2
    (Data collected by Beacon from rest forwarding nodes)
- ES_MDS
    (Data collected by Beacon from MDS)
- ES_Latency
    (Data collected by Beacon from forwarding nodes, on LWFS servers, including queue length and latency)
- ES_OST1
    (Data collected by Beacon from default storage nodes)
- ES_OST2
    (Data collected by Beacon from rest storage nodes)
- ES_network
    (Data collected by Beacon from IB switches)
